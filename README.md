## üß† **Project Overview ‚Äì LUSC on TON**

**LUSC (Liquidity Union Smart Collective)** is a next-generation token built on the **TON blockchain**, designed to function as a decentralized, multi-asset investment instrument. By holding LUSC, users gain diversified exposure to a curated and actively managed portfolio of various cryptocurrencies‚Äîprimarily within the TON ecosystem and strategically selected external assets.

LUSC simplifies crypto investing by letting holders benefit from a range of assets through one token, managed by DAO governance and backed by a transparent, on-chain treasury.

## üéØ **Project Mission**

To empower users on TON with:

- **Simple access** to diversified crypto exposure through a single asset.
- **Reduced individual asset risk** via intelligent allocation and automated rebalancing.
- **Growth of the TON ecosystem** by actively purchasing and supporting TON-native tokens and dApps.
- A **community-governed treasury** that invests, manages, and optimizes yield on behalf of LUSC holders.

## üîç **Why LUSC on TON Is Needed**

1. **TON is booming**, but discovering quality projects is time-consuming.
2. **Retail investors face high risk** and complexity in managing diverse portfolios.
3. **No index-style solution exists yet on TON**‚ÄîLUSC fills this gap.
4. **One token, many opportunities**: exposure to DeFi, GameFi, NFT infrastructure, and more.
